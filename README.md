- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Joe Wallace

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Drug Design and Machine Learning.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on a project in which I have accessed a dataset of ~300k small molecules and their binding affinities for the protein Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/target_report_card/CHEMBL1075138/). I am using this as a mini project to gain further experience in machine learning, with an emphasis on drug design. 
- At this stage I am aiming to dock the small molecules to the protein target using LeDock then use ProLif to analyse the specific ligand-protein molecular interactions.
