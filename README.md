👋 Hi, I’m Joe Wallace — computational chemistry / molecular screening pipeline engineer.

I design and build reproducible molecular screening engines that combine cheminformatics, molecular simulation, and machine learning to produce decision-grade binding and aggregation data.

My work focuses on:
• automated molecular system generation
• large-scale ligand screening on HPC clusters
• physics-grounded binding / aggregation metrics
• uncertainty-aware ranking pipelines
• end-to-end reproducible research infrastructure

Current core project:
→ Molecular Screening Engine (MSE)
An automated platform for screening and ranking small molecules against nanoplastic and biomolecular targets using AMBER, PLUMED, RDKit, Packmol, and Python-based analysis pipelines.
Outputs: ranked binding tables, free-energy metrics, aggregation propensities, and decision-ready reports.

Research domains:
• nanoplastics aggregation & contaminant capture
• physics-informed molecular ML
• high-throughput screening automation
• free-energy & enhanced sampling methods
• cheminformatics pipelines

Currently:
Postdoctoral researcher at IIT Genova (computational nanomaterials & molecular screening)
