# 👋 Hi, I’m Joe Wallace

Computational chemistry / molecular screening pipeline engineer.

I design and build reproducible molecular screening engines that combine cheminformatics, molecular simulation, and machine learning to produce decision-grade binding and aggregation data.

## What I work on

* Automated molecular system generation
* Large-scale ligand screening on HPC clusters
* Physics-grounded binding & aggregation metrics
* Uncertainty-aware ranking pipelines
* End-to-end reproducible research infrastructure

---

## Current Core Project

### Molecular Screening Engine (MSE)

An automated platform for screening and ranking small molecules against nanoplastic and biomolecular targets using:

* AMBER
* PLUMED
* RDKit
* Packmol
* Python-based analysis pipelines

**Outputs**

* Ranked binding tables
* Free-energy metrics
* Aggregation propensities
* Decision-ready reports

## Research Domains

* Nanoplastics aggregation & contaminant capture
* Physics-informed molecular ML
* High-throughput screening automation
* Free-energy & enhanced sampling methods
* Cheminformatics pipelines
